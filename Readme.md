# The Impact of Sleep Quality on Well-being and Productivity - Ironhack DSML Bootcamp - First Project

## Project Overview
Using the data collected form a survey, we analyze the answers of 3858 people regarding their sleeping time the night before, their screen time before sleeping, their waking time, caffeine intake, if they exercised during the day and for how long, how many hours they worked and rated their sleep quality, mood, stress level and how productive they were throughout the day. The data was gathered from random samples of individuals on a single day, ensuring that the analysis is cross-sectional and not focused on long-term trends or habitual patterns. 

### Key Objectives:
- **Slept hours and productivity**: Analyzes is the total sleeping hours influence the productivity throughout the day.
- **Sleep Duration and Quality**: Analyzes if sleeping more hours means better rest.
- **Excercise, caffeine and screen time before bed and sleep quality**: Analysis to chek wether these activities could affect the quality of sleep.
- **Relation between stress levels and mood, based on sleep quality**: Analyses if sleep quality could be affected by those factor..
